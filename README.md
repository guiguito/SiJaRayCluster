This is an experimental version of SiJaRay which enables clustering rendering. 

This is one is fully from the ground using TCP socket.

There are 3 eclipse projects that you can simply import.

There are no documentations for it. Some might find it useful.

## Support
This raytracer was made 8 years ago at the end of my studies when i studied six months at the RIT.
I should have open sourced it years ago but never took the time to release it.
I don't  plan to provide any support neither to update it.
Do not hesitate to modify it, fork it or update it.
